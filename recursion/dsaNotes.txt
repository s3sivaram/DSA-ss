---------------------
Permutations in String:N!.
---------------------
SubArray: contigous part of array.
    -No of non empty SubArrays= n*(n+1)/2.

Subsequence: may not be contigous but the order has to be maintained.
    -No of non empty SubSequences= 2^n-1.
    - no of SubSequences = 2^n.

---------------------
Graph:
    Vertices in a Graph:V
    Full Dense Graph will have V * V-1  edges.

---------------------

Time complexity:
1) array
2) set
