Points to ponder at the start...

1) who are the users of the system?
    (e.g) food delivery app- endusers or Hotel owners or management....
2) what are the modules involved in the system  and which one to focus now?
    (e.g) food delivery tracking or
          geo-location tracking for the nearest hotel list etc...
3) what are the trade offs for CAP ?
   consistency, availability, performance,

4) level of scaling of the system - global or local?

5) Sequence of events in each module.

6) API design.

7) Monolith vs. Microservices based on scale of the system ....

8) Communication protocols - http / websocket / mqtt / grpc etc.

9) Data capacity - how much data can be stored in the system?

10) Datastore decision - relational / NoSQL / etc.

11) Scaling the system: vertical or horizontal?

12) performance - caching / compression / sharding.

13) Diaster recovery - how to handle the failure? - Fail safe & fail proof

14) How to handle the data loss?

15) Health check - how to check the health of the system?
16) Logging & monitoring the system.
