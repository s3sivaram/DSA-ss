React notes:

Components re-render when

- parent Components re-render, all of its child Components will re-render.
- when a state change occurs, that component will re-render.
- when object reference/function re change(which will change on each render if not memoized) Components will re-render.

- all Components(& its corresponding children) that consumes a context will render when that context gets updated.

- useMemo to be used to memoize the child component to prevent re-render due to Object/function reference changes.


- to avoid a child component from unneccesary re-rendering(when no props are passed),pass the child component as {children} to the parent than embedding child in the parent directly.

React.memo - memoize to prevent re-render of the child Components when its parent component re-renders.Re-render of child will not happen if the child component's props didn't change from its previous render.
But React.memo cannot memoize Objects / functions. so in that case use "useMemo" hook.
